# jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

This application records employee salaries and adds salaries up to report monthly costs.

An input form collects _employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary_.

The 'Submit' button collects the form information, stores the information to calculate monthly costs, appends information to the DOM and clears the input fields. Using the stored information,  monthly costs are calculated and appended to the DOM. If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, a red background color behind the total monthly cost indicates excess.

The delete button removes an employee from the DOM.
