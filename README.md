# jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
I created a form that collects employee information, calculates their monthly costs, and adds their information to a table. The program can also identify which monthly costs are exceeding $20,000.

If an employee is deleted from the table, the total spend on salaries is updated.
